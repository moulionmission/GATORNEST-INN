___BACKEND___

### User Stories (Backend)
__Reservation Model__: As a hotel administrator,
I want to ensure that all our booking are securely stored in a MySQL database,
So that we can quickly and safely access data.

__Guest Information & Payment Information Storage__: As a hotel administrator,
I want a secure system to manage guest profiles and billing information,
So that I can keep personal data and payment details safe and private.

__Staff Scheduler__: As a hotel manager,
I want to create and update staff schedules within the system,
So that I can reduce scheduling conflicts & ensure resources are used effectively.

__Secure Payment Processor__: As a guest,
I want the backend to securely handle my payment transactions,
So that I can be confident that my transaction is safe and protected.

__Room Availability Tracker__: As a backend service,
I need to track room availability for both current and upcoming reservations,
So that receptionists can make informed decisions when booking rooms.

### What backend issues we planned to address
"Develop Reservation Model" and "Develop Staff Scheduling"

### What backend issues were completed, not completed, and why/why not

We completed the reservation model issue but not the staff scheduling issue 
because it relied on the reservation model issue to be completed first. Since 
the reservation model schema took longer than usual, we were unable to complete 
the staff scheduling issue.
