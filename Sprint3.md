Demo Video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-lcOqpQGe7xOU7GreFO7C5n0pOZzp6HN/preview

___FRONTEND___

In sprint 3, significant updates were made to improve user interaction and user interface design, leveraging animations and modal pop-ups. The AOS library was introduced to provide scroll-based animations, enhancing the user experience. Additionally, a booking modal was added to facilitate room reservations, incorporating functionality for fee calculation and data input forms.

Key Features Implemented:
=========================

1\. AOS (Animate On Scroll):
----------------------------

Description: The AOS library was integrated into both the Footer and Main components to provide smooth, scroll-based animations when elements come into view. This enhances the visual appeal of the application and guides the userâ€™s attention to key areas of the page.

Usage:  
 - In the Footer component, various elements like text, links, and icons fade in when they enter the viewport.  
 - In the Main component, each room card fades in with an animation as the user scrolls down the page.

Implementation:  
 - The AOS library was initialized in the useEffect hook to apply the fade-up effect on elements as they come into view.

2\. Modal Popup for Room Booking:
---------------------------------

Description: A modal popup was introduced in the Main component to allow users to book rooms. The modal is triggered when a user clicks the 'Book' button on any room card.

Functionality:  
 - The user is prompted to enter personal details, including their name, email, and booking dates.  
 - The total fee is dynamically calculated based on the selected room and the number of nights the user intends to stay.  
 - Once the user confirms the booking, the details are logged, and the modal is closed.

Implementation:  
 - A useState hook is used to manage the state of the modal, selected room details, and form data.  
 - The 'handleBookClick' function triggers the modal and sets the room's fee and title.  
 - The 'handleBookingConfirm' function logs the booking details.  
 - The modal includes an input form for collecting user details and booking dates.

3\. Dynamic Fee Calculation:
----------------------------

Description: The application calculates the total fee for a room based on the start and end dates selected by the user. This functionality is tied to the modal where users input their booking dates.

Implementation:  
 - The 'calculateFee' function computes the total fee based on the number of nights between the selected start and end dates.

4\. Room Availability Fetching:
-------------------------------

Description: The availability of rooms is fetched from the backend based on the room type. This feature allows users to check the availability of rooms before confirming their booking.

Implementation:  
 - A function 'fetchAvailableRooms' is used to send a request to the backend to retrieve available rooms for the selected room type.  
 - The response is displayed in a list showing available room numbers and their price.

Impact:
=======

User Experience: The integration of AOS animations provides a more dynamic and engaging user interface, improving the overall feel of the website.

Functionality: The modal popup and fee calculation functionalities make the booking process more seamless, allowing users to complete their reservations easily and view the associated costs in real time.

Backend Integration: The feature to fetch available rooms based on the selected room type enhances the interactive experience and ensures users have access to up-to-date information.

Future Enhancements:
====================

Form Validation: Adding validation to the booking form to ensure that all fields are correctly filled before submission.

API Integration: Implementing a complete backend API to handle room bookings and data storage.

Conclusion:
===========

Sprint 3 successfully implemented several key features that enhance both the visual appeal and usability of the application. The integration of AOS for animations and the booking modal provides a solid foundation for further features and improvements in the upcoming sprints.

___BACKEND___

In sprint 3, we have made the following progress for the backend:
- Paused development on payment system and reallocated efforts into new login/register feature
- Implemented Basic Reservation model and token-based login/registration functionality in SQL
- Link data to authenticated users


- Ran Unit Tests on Backend API endpoints
- Continued the GO SQL Backend API with the frontend, although more of a challenge now
